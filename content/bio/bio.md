I’m Hikari Murayama — a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley’s Energy and Resources Group, where I use machine learning and remote sensing to study carbon emissions and land use change. My work spans both history and modern-day climate challenges: I reconstruct past landscapes in Africa from archival aerial photos and use satellite data to monitor carbon dioxide emissions from power plants today.

I’m passionate about interdisciplinary approaches to environmental research — bringing together tools from deep learning, geospatial analysis, and policy. I’ve been fortunate to be a Fellow at the UW eScience Institute’s Data Science for Social Good program and at Berkeley’s D-Lab, and I’m currently a Doctoral Fellow at the Global Policy Lab at Stanford. My research is supported by the Quad Fellowship and UC’s Dissertation Fellowship.

Before grad school, I worked in economic consulting and led applied remote sensing projects at NASA DEVELOP. I studied Chemical Physics at Wellesley College, where I first became interested in research.

When I’m not working with code or satellite imagery, I enjoy hiking, planning my next food/coffee/matcha excursion, and going to hot yoga.
